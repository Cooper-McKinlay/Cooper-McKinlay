Hi, I’m @Cooper-McKinlay
I'm a intern in the Tampa Bay Area.
My focus is on electrical engineering, both with hardware and software.
My hobbies include Dungeons and Dragons, Magic: the Gathering, and a wide variety of video games and other tabletop games.
I'm excited to collaborate and learn with others!
